# Aleatoric MCP Prompts

Use these ready-to-run prompts in your MCP-capable IDE (Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code Copilot, or Cline).

- "Validate this config: symbol BTC, seed 42, volatility 0.02"
- "List available presets for perpetual futures"
- "Simulate 10 days of funding rates on HyperLiquid with spot=50000 and mark=50100"
- "What exchanges does Aleatoric support?"
- "Export my cached dataset as Parquet"

For cache inspection, attach the resource from `get_cache_stats` and then call `stream_cache` or `export_cache`.
